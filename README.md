# Wallet App

A simple wallet application built using ReactJS (v19) and Material UI that allows users to set up a wallet, perform transactions (credit or debit), and view transaction history with pagination. The application communicates with a backend API to handle wallet setup, transactions, and transaction history retrieval.
